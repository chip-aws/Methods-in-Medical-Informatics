Creating a new relational database by porting data from a large biomedical data set is a task more suited to a biomedical scientist than to a database programmer. The typical SQL data insertion statement commits the insertion and waits for the data to be loaded to disk before preparing the next insertion statement. This step, repeated thousands or millions of time, greatly impedes scripts such as ours, which loaded a data set into a database. In our script, we used a method that opens a transaction process that parses our entire data set before committing the process. This simple trick permits the rapid execution of the script."
