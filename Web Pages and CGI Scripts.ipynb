    "ISP (Internet Service Provider) for a Web account, or by asking your company\n",

    "will explain to you how you can deposit, via FTP, Web pages (that you create)\n",
    "onto the public_html directory. The provider will also explain how you can\n",
    "deposit your CGI scripts onto the cgi-bin subdirectory. He will also explain\n",
    "how you can assign settings to your CGI scripts that restrict access to certain\n",
    "sets of users. The provider will also tell you if there are limitations on the kinds\n",
    "of scripts permitted on the server (e.g., specific versions of a language might be\n",
    "required by the server, and the server may be set up for one language and not\n",
    "another).\n",
    "2. Create a Web page that creates an HTML form. Almost every HTML book\n",
    "contains information about forms. Forms are HTML objects that accept user\n",
    "input and send the input to a designated server. Text boxes and radio buttons\n",
    "are commonly encountered form objects. They can be created in just a\n",
    "few lines of HTML code. You will put the Web page in your public_html\n",
    "directory. This Web page will be accessible to anyone in the world who happens\n",
    "to know the Web address of the HTML page. Your server manager will\n",
    "provide you with the Web address of your public_html directory, and the\n",
    "complete address of the Web page is simply the HTML file name appended\n",
    "to the directory address.\n",
    "3. Create a script that sits in the cgi-bin subdirectory of a server, whose specific\n",
    "address is included in the form that you previously included in your Web\n",
    "page. When anyone viewing your Web page, enters information in the form,\n",
    "and submits the information (usually by clicking on a button in the form), the\n",
    "information will be sent to your server-side script and processed.\n",
    "This describes the basic steps for a CGI script. With a little imagination, you can see\n",
