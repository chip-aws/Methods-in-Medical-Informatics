    "Welcome to chapter fourteen of Methods in Medical Informatics! In this section, we will be exploring autocoding. Often in biomedical informatics, it is necessary to extract medical terms from text and attach a nomenclature concept code to the extracted term. A software product that computationally parses and codes medical text is called an autocoder or an automatic coder. By coding, concepts of interest contained in text can be retrieved regardless of the choice of words used to describe them. Lets begin!\n",

    "generate a terabyte of data each week. A slow autocoder could never keep up\n",
    "with the volume of medical information that is produced each day.\n",

    "to accommodate unexpected oddities in the text that they parse (particularly\n",
    "formatting oddities and the inclusion of idiosyncratic language to express\n",
    "medical terms). The cycles of running a program, reviewing output, making\n",
    "modifications in software or nomenclatures, and repeating the whole process\n",
    "many times cannot be undertaken if you need to wait a week for your autocoding\n",
    "software to parse your text.\n",
    "3. Autocoding is as much about recoding as it is about the initial process of providing\n",
    "nomenclature codes.\n",
    "You need to recode (supply a new set of nomenclature codes for terms in your medical\n",
    "text) whenever you want to change from one nomenclature to another.\n",
    "You need to recode whenever you introduce a new version of a nomenclature.\n",
    "You need to recode whenever you want to use a new coding algorithm (e.g., parsimonious\n",
    "coding versus comprehensive, or linking code to a particular extracted portion\n",
    "of report).\n",
    "You need to recode whenever you add legacy data to your laboratory information\n",
    "systems.\n",
    "You need to recode whenever you merge different medical data sets (especially,\n",
    "medical data sets that have been coded with different medical nomenclatures).\n",
    "All of this recoding adds to the data burden placed on a medical autocoder.\n",
    "It has been my personal observation that computational tasks that take much time\n",
    "(more than a few seconds) tend to be put on the back burner. The same observations\n",
    "would apply to medical deidentification software (Chapter 15), software designed to\n",
